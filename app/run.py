# This is a fully-documented example of how to do manual verification with nio,

# you want live verification using emojis, the process is more complicated and
# will be covered in another example.

# We're building on the restore_login example here to preserve device IDs and
# therefore preserve trust; if @bob trusts @alice's device ID ABC and @alice
# restarts this program, loading the same keys, @bob will preserve trust. If
# @alice logged in again @alice would have new keys and a device ID XYZ, and
# @bob wouldn't trust it.

# The store is where we want to place encryption details like our keys, trusted
# devices and blacklisted devices. Here we place it in the working directory,
# but if you deploy your program you might consider /var or /opt for storage

# account on another device), this program will refuse to send a message in the
# room. Try it!
